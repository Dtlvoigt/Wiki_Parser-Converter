Ironically, the claimed \"paradoxical\" properties of ZZspace, particularly that two or more ranks can share more than one cell, seem to be an artifact of trying to present ranks as if traversing them corresponded to movement in a direction (which we\'re explicitly told it doesn\'t).\n\nIt would be interesting to know where the Zig Zag idea came from. It seems as if one could possibly get there by starting with the idea of a doubly-linked list, then relaxing the implicit constraint that a cell has only the one pair of pointers. That kind of thing is very very hard, exactly because the constraint is so well hidden.\n----\n\n\'\'The following deals with the current prototype.

The interesting thing is, that\nthese Links are categorized using \"Dimensions\".\n\nQuote: STRUCTURE DIMENSIONS\n\n\t :\tThe cell structure may have any number of dimensions, though the system begins with only seven (d.1, d.2, d.3, d.cursor, d.clone, d.mark, d.contain, d.contain2). (The functions of these are explained at the end.)\n\nTwo off these Dimensions are visualised by displaying a two-demensional\ngraph of the cell-structure on the screen.\n\nQuote: VIEWING AXES\n\n\t :\tThere are three viewing axes: x, y and z. The current view in each window maps the cell structure to the viewing axes, assigning these three axes to whatever structure dimensions you specify.\n\nVIEWING THE STRUCTURE DIMENSIONS\n\n\t :\tYou may quickly change the mapping of the ZigZag world\'s dimensions to the window\'s viewing axes.\n\n\t :\tTyping x, y or z in lower case causes the view in the right window to step by one dimension on the specified viewing axis (x, y or z).  Typing X, Y or Z in upper case causes the view in the left window to step by one dimension in the specified viewing axis (X, Y or Z)\n\n\nDIMENSION FUNCTIONS.\n\t :\tStructure dimensions d.1, d.2 and d.3 have no assigned functions.  Think of d.1 as useful for headings, d.2 as useful for virtual lists, d.1 and d.2 together for ordinary tables and very interesting basket-weave structures, and d.3 as a third dimension.\n \n\t :\tThe \"Cursor\" dimension, d.cursor, is the dimension on which a cursor (actually a cell) is connected to the cell it\'s on (the accursed cell); the user cannot change connections on the cursor dimension, except by explicitly moving the cursor, but the cursor dimension can be viewed like any other dimension.\n\n\t :\tThe \"Clone\" dimension, d.clone, is the dimension on which a cloned cell is always connected to its original; this connection is enforced by the system, so you cannot disconnect a clone from its master, though you can rearrange clones on the clone dimension.  \'\'Note that editing any clone or its master changes all the others of outs chain\'\' -- i.e., any clones of that same master, and the master itself, all are changed identically if any is changed.\n \nMaking Links to existing pages require that you clone the cell.\nSo the viewing the Clone-Dimension you see the  \"Backlinks\" of that\nCell.\n\n\t :\tThe \"Mark\" dimension (not implemented) will be for marking cells, especially strips and groups of cells, in preparation for some operation.  The marked cells will have other cells (marking cells) connected to them on the Mark dimension.\n\n\t :\tThe \"Contain\" dimension, d.contain, is the dimension representing containment: we represent cell A as being inside cell B by connecting it posward from B on the Contain dimension.  (In the next version it will be called d.inside.)\n\n\t :\tThe \"Contain2\" dimension (which willl be called \"d.contents\" in tne next version) allows a given cell to contain more than one thing. Anything contained after the first cell contained is posward on d.contain2 from the first cell contained.\n\n\t :\tBy looking at these specific connections, the system quickly determines what a cell contains or is contained by.\n\nThis looks very interesting... but I have to really use the system\nto actually understand it. -- MarcusDenker\n----\nSee also http://gzigzag.sourceforge.net.
